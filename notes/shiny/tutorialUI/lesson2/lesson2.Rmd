## Build a user-interface

Now that you understand the structure of a Shiny app, it’s time to build your first app from scratch.

This lesson will show you how to build a user-interface for your app. You will learn how to lay out the user-interface and then add text, images, and other HTML elements to your Shiny app.

```{r}
library(shiny)
```

We’ll use the `App-1` app you made in Lesson 1. To get started, open its `server.R` and `ui.R` files. Edit the scripts to match the ones below:

`ui.R`
```
shinyUI(fluidPage(
))
```

`server.R`
```
shinyServer(function(input, output) {
})
```

This code is the bare minimum needed to create a Shiny app. The result is an empty app with a blank user-interface, an appropriate starting point for this lesson.

### Layout

Shiny `ui.R` scripts use the function `fluidPage` to create a display that automatically adjusts to the dimensions of your user’s browser window. You lay out your app by placing elements in the fluidPage function.

For example, the ui.R script below creates a user-interface that has a title panel and then a sidebar layout, which includes a sidebar panel and a main panel. Note that these elements are placed within the fluidPage function.
```
# ui.R

shinyUI(fluidPage(
  titlePanel("title panel"),

  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel( "sidebar panel"),
    mainPanel("main panel")
  )
))
```

`titlePanel` and `sidebarLayout` are the two most popular elements to add to `fluidPage`. They create a basic Shiny app with a sidebar.

`sidebarLayout` always takes two arguments:  

* `sidebarPanel` function output  

* `mainPanel` function output  

These functions place content in either the sidebar or the main panels. The sidebar panel will appear on the left side of your app by default. You can move it to the right side by giving `sidebarLayout` the optional argument `position = "right"`.
```
# ui.R

shinyUI(fluidPage(
  titlePanel("title panel"),

  sidebarLayout(position = "right",
    sidebarPanel( "sidebar panel"),
    mainPanel("main panel")
  )
))
```

`titlePanel` and `sidebarLayout` create a basic layout for your Shiny app, but you can also create more advanced layouts. You can use `navbarPage` to give your app a multi-page user-interface that includes a navigation bar. Or you can use `fluidRow` and `column` to build your layout up from a grid system. If you’d like to learn more about these advanced options, read the Shiny Application Layout Guide. We will stick with `sidebarLayout` in this tutorial.

### HTML Content

You can add content to your Shiny app by placing it inside a `*Panel` function. For example, the apps above display a character string in each of their panels. The words “sidebar panel” appear in the `sidebar panel`, because we added the string to the `sidebarPanel` function, e.g., `sidebarPanel("sidebar panel")`. The same is true for the text in the title panel and the main panel.

To add more advanced content, use one of Shiny’s HTML tag functions. These functions parallel common HTML5 tags. Let’s try out a few of them. (See the tutorial.)

### Headers

To create a header element:

* select a header function (e.g., h1 or h5)

* give it the text you want to see in the header

For example, you can create a first level header that says “My title” with h1("My title"). If you run the command at the command line, you’ll notice that it produces HTML code.
```{r}
library(shiny)
h1("My title")
# <h1>My title</h1>
```

To place the element in your app:

* pass h1("My title") as an argument to titlePanel, sidebarPanel, or mainPanel

The text will appear in the corresponding panel of your web page. You can place multiple elements in the same panel if you separate them with a comma.

Give this a try. The new script below uses all six levels of headers. Update your `ui.R` to match the script and then relaunch your app. Remember to relaunch a Shiny app you may run `runApp("App-1")`, click the Run App button, or use your keyboard shortcuts.
```
# ui.R

shinyUI(fluidPage(
  titlePanel("My Shiny App"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(),
    mainPanel(
      h1("First level title"),
      h2("Second level title"),
      h3("Third level title"),
      h4("Fourth level title"),
      h5("Fifth level title"),
      h6("Sixth level title")
    )
  )
))
```

You can create this effect with `align = "center"`, as in `h6("Episode IV", align = "center")`. In general, any HTML tag attribute can be set as an argument in any Shiny tag function.

If you are unfamiliar with HTML tag attributes, you can look them up in one of the many free online HTML resources such as w3schools.

Here’s the code that made the Star Wars-inspired user-interface:
```
# ui.R

shinyUI(fluidPage(
  titlePanel("My Shiny App"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(),
    mainPanel(
        h6("Episode IV", align = "center"),
        h6("A NEW HOPE", align = "center"),
        h5("It is a period of civil war.", align = "center"),
        h4("Rebel spaceships, striking", align = "center"),
        h3("from a hidden base, have won", align = "center"),
        h2("their first victory against the", align = "center"),
        h1("evil Galactic Empire.")
    )
  )
))
```

### Formatted text

Shiny offers many tag functions for formatting text. The easiest way to describe them is by running through an example.

Paste the `ui.R` script below into your `ui.R` file and save it. If your Shiny app is still running, you can refresh your web page or preview window, and it will display the changes. If your app is closed, just relaunch it.

Compare the displayed app to your updated ui.R script to discover how to format text in a Shiny app.
```
# ui.R

shinyUI(fluidPage(
  titlePanel("My Shiny App"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(),
    mainPanel(
      p("p creates a paragraph of text."),
      p("A new p() command starts a new paragraph. Supply a style attribute to change the format of the entire paragraph.", style = "font-family: 'times'; font-si16pt"),
      strong("strong() makes bold text."),
      em("em() creates italicized (i.e, emphasized) text."),
      br(),
      code("code displays your text similar to computer code"),
      div("div creates segments of text with a similar style. This division of text is all blue because I passed the argument 'style = color:blue' to div", style = "color:blue"),
      br(),
      p("span does the same thing as div, but it works with",
        span("groups of words", style = "color:blue"),
        "that appear inside a paragraph.")
    )
  )
))
```

### Images

Images can enhance the appearance of your app and help your users understand the content. Shiny looks for the `img` function to place image files in your app.

To insert an image, give the `img` function the name of your image file as the src argument (e.g., `img(src = "my_image.png"))`. You must spell out this argument since img passes your input to an HTML tag, and `src` is what the tag expects.

You can also include other HTML friendly parameters such as height and width. Note that height and width numbers will refer to pixels.
```
img(src = "my_image.png", height = 72, width = 72)
```

The `img` function looks for your image file in a specific place. Your file must be in a folder named `www` in the same directory as the `ui.R` script. Shiny treats this directory in a special way. Shiny will share any file placed here with your user’s web browser, which makes `www` a great place to put images, style sheets, and other things the browser will need to build the wep components of your Shiny app.

With this file arrangment, the ui.R script below can create this app. Download bigorb.png here and try it out.

# ui.R
```
shinyUI(fluidPage(
  titlePanel("My Shiny App"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(),
    mainPanel(
      img(src="bigorb.png", height = 400, width = 400)
    )
  )
))
```

### Recap

With your new skills, you can:

* create a user-interface with fluidPage, titlePanel and sidebarLayout

* create an HTML element with one of Shiny’s tag functions

* set HTML tag attributes in the arguments of each tag function

* add an element to your web page by passing it to titlePanel, sidebarPanel or mainPanel

* add multiple elements to each panel by separating them with a comma

* add images by placing your image in a folder labeled www within your Shiny app directory and then calling the img function
