## Welcome to Shiny

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web applications (apps) straight from R. This lesson will get you started building Shiny apps right away.

The Shiny package has eleven built-in examples that each demonstrate how Shiny works. Each example is a self-contained Shiny app.

The `Hello Shiny` example plots a histogram of R’s `faithful` dataset with a configurable number of bins. Users can change the number of bins with a slider bar, and the app will immediately respond to their input. You’ll use Hello Shiny to explore the structure of a Shiny app and to create your first app.

To run Hello Shiny, type:
```
library(shiny)
runExample("01_hello")
```

### Structure of a Shiny App

Shiny apps have two components:

* a user-interface script  
* a server script  

The user-interface (ui) script controls the layout and appearance of your app. It is defined in a source script named `ui.R`. Here is the `ui.R` script for the Hello Shiny example.

`ui.R`
```
library(shiny)

# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
shinyUI(fluidPage(

  # Application title
  titlePanel("Hello Shiny!"),

  # Sidebar with a slider input for the number of bins
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      sliderInput("bins",
                  "Number of bins:",
                  min = 1,
                  max = 50,
                  value = 30)
    ),

    # Show a plot of the generated distribution
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("distPlot")
    )
  )
))
```

The `server.R` script contains the instructions that your computer needs to build your app. Here is the `server.R` script for the Hello Shiny example.

`server.R`
```
library(shiny)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
shinyServer(function(input, output) {

  # Expression that generates a histogram. The expression is
  # wrapped in a call to renderPlot to indicate that:
  #
  #  1) It is "reactive" and therefore should re-execute automatically
  #     when inputs change
  #  2) Its output type is a plot

  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    x    <- faithful[, 2]  # Old Faithful Geyser data
    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

    # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
    hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
  })
})
```

At one level, the Hello Shiny `server.R` script is very simple. The script does some calculations and then plots a histogram with the requested number of bins.

However, you’ll also notice that most of the script is wrapped in a call to `renderPlot`. The comment above the function explains a bit about this, but if you find it confusing, don’t worry. We’ll cover this concept in much more detail soon.

Play with the Hello Shiny app and review the source code. Try to develop a feel for how the app works.

Your R session will be busy while the Hello Shiny app is active, so you will not be able to run any R commands. R is monitoring the app and executing the app’s reactions. To get your R session back, hit escape or click the stop sign icon (found in the upper right corner of the RStudio console panel).

### Running an App

Every Shiny app has the same structure: two R scripts saved together in a directory. At a minimum, a Shiny app has `ui.R` and `server.R` files.

You can create a Shiny app by making a new directory and saving a `ui.R` and `server.R` file inside it. Each app will need its own unique directory.

You can run a Shiny app by giving the name of its directory to the function runApp. For example if your Shiny app is in a directory called my_app, run it with the following code:
```
library(shiny)
runApp("my_app")
```

Note: `runApp` is similar to `read.csv`, `read.table`, and many other functions in R. The first argument of `runApp` is the filepath from your working directory to the app’s directory. The code above assumes that the app directory is in your working directory. In this case, the filepath is just the name of the directory.

(In case you are wondering, the Hello Shiny app’s files are saved in a special system directory called "01_hello". This directory is designed to work with the runExample ("01_hello") call.)

### Your Turn

Create a new directory named App-1 in your working directory. Then copy and paste the `ui.R` and `server.R` scripts above into your directory (the scripts from Hello Shiny). 

Launch your app by running `runApp("App-1")`. Then click escape and make some changes to your app:

1. Change the title from “Hello Shiny!” to “Hello World!”.  

2. Set the minimum value of the slider bar to 5.  

3. Change the histogram color from "darkgray" to "skyblue".  

When you are ready, launch your app again. Your new app should match the image below. If it doesn’t, or if you want to check your code, press the model answers button to reveal how we did these tasks.

By default, Shiny apps display in “normal” mode, like the app pictured above. Hello Shiny and the other built in examples display in “showcase mode”, a different mode that displays the `server.R` and `ui.R` scripts alongside the app.

If you would like your app to display in showcase mode, you can run `runApp("App-1", display.mode = "showcase")`.
